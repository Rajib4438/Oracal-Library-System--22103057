University Library Management System
Database (MySQL/Oracle/SQL Server) Course - Final Assignment

üìã Assignment Overview
This project represents the final assignment for the Database course, focusing on the development and implementation of a fully functional University Library Management System. Oracle Database has been used as the primary RDBMS platform to meet all specified requirements. The project reflects the culmination of concepts taught throughout the course and applies real-world database practices in a university setting.

Assignment Objectives
The primary aim of this assignment is to demonstrate proficiency in designing and implementing a robust database system for managing university library operations. It showcases my understanding of normalization principles, relational database theory, and practical implementation using complex SQL queries and PL/SQL programming. Additionally, it highlights my knowledge of database security mechanisms and performance optimization strategies.

Learning Outcomes Achieved
Throughout the completion of this assignment, I have effectively applied ER modeling and normalization techniques to design the system. I have demonstrated SQL proficiency across DML, DDL, DCL, and TCL operations. Moreover, I implemented PL/SQL code‚Äîincluding procedures, functions, and triggers‚Äîto support business logic. I also undertook essential database administration tasks such as user management and query optimization.

üéì Assignment Parts Completed
Part 1: Database Design & Setup (15 Marks)
In this phase, I created all essential tables‚ÄîBOOKS, MEMBERS, and TRANSACTIONS‚Äîensuring appropriate constraints were applied. Sample data, including 20 books, 15 members, and 25 transactions, were inserted for testing and demonstration purposes.

Part 2: Basic SQL Operations (20 Marks)
I developed various SQL queries for data retrieval such as identifying available books, overdue members, and frequently borrowed books. Data manipulation queries were also written to update fines, add members, and archive old transactions.

Part 3: Advanced SQL Queries (25 Marks)
This section includes join operations (INNER, LEFT, SELF, and CROSS JOINs), subqueries, and advanced query constructs using aggregate and window functions. These queries offer insights like identifying top users and borrowing trends.

Part 4: PL/SQL Programming (25 Marks)
Three core PL/SQL components were developed: the ISSUE_BOOK procedure, CALCULATE_FINE function, and a trigger that updates the book inventory upon return. These automate critical library processes and enforce data integrity.

Part 5: Database Administration (15 Marks)
This part involved the creation of user roles such as librarian and student_user with defined privileges. I also implemented performance improvements using indexing and analyzed execution plans for optimization.

‚≠ê Key Features
1. Comprehensive Data Management
Books Management includes tracking title, author, publisher, ISBN, category classification, and inventory status. It ensures real-time monitoring of available copies.

Member Management supports multiple user types‚Äîstudents, faculty, and staff‚Äîand stores detailed contact information. Membership types and statuses are also maintained.

Transaction Management allows full tracking of borrow and return operations, including dates and fine status. It provides a clear audit trail for all activity.

2. Advanced Querying Capabilities
Data Retrieval includes book availability, overdue items, top-borrowed analytics, and activity summaries.

Data Manipulation features automated updates for fines, new member onboarding, and historical archiving.

Join Operations support detailed reports through INNER, LEFT, SELF, and CROSS JOINs across tables.

Subqueries help in identifying patterns such as most active users or those incurring high fines.

Analytics & Reporting employs aggregate functions and window operations for meaningful insights into library usage.

3. PL/SQL Automation & Business Logic
ISSUE_BOOK Procedure automates the issuance process by validating availability, inserting transactions, updating inventory, and handling errors.

CALCULATE_FINE Function accepts a transaction ID and dynamically calculates overdue fines using a daily rate model.

UPDATE_AVAILABLE_COPIES Trigger ensures real-time adjustment of the inventory when books are returned.

4. Database Administration
Security and User Management involves role-based access control where librarians have full privileges and student_users have limited read access.

Performance Optimization is achieved through strategic indexing, query tuning, and use of execution plans to improve response time and scalability.

üìä Database Schema
Tables Created
BOOKS ‚Äì Includes book_id, title, author, publisher, publication_year, ISBN, category, total_copies, available_copies, and price.

MEMBERS ‚Äì Stores member_id, full name, email, phone, address, membership info, and type.

TRANSACTIONS ‚Äì Tracks each borrowing activity with transaction_id, member_id, book_id, issue and return dates, fines, and status.
